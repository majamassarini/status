Testing Farm infrastructure is having an outage resulting in test jobs being stuck in queued state.
You can watch the status of the outage here: https://status.testing-farm.io/issues/2024-10-01-public-ranch-outage/.

If the jobs end on error they can be [retriggered](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/upstream/tests#restart-testing) by commenting `/packit test` in the corresponding pull requests.
