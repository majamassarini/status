There was a New Hotness outage resulting in no Bugzillas about new release being filed.
As a result, no Packit update dist-git pull requests were created.

Please [trigger](https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide/dist-git-onboarding#pull_from_upstream)
the release syncs manually if you are affected by commenting in any dist-git pull request:

    /packit pull-from-upstream

We are very sorry for the inconvenience!
